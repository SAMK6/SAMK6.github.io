            About Me
        </h1>

        <p>
            I am currently a student researcher working toward my master's degree in computing science at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Dr. Bailey Kacsmar. Previously I received my bachelor's degree with honours from the University of Western Ontario where I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics.

            I am broadly interested in cryptography and it's applications. I'm interesting in projects where I get to use both my coding and math skills to design, analyse, or augment cryptographic primitives and protocols. Currently I'm looking at the ways combinatorics can be used in cryptography, specifically secret sharing.

            I am also an avid chess player and on the side I am developing a chess bot!
